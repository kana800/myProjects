> This is a fast paced introductory course to `C++` programming language. We will be following the [MIT's 6.096 Course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-096-introduction-to-c-january-iap-2011/index.htm). Note that this course doesn't contain any videos. I will be watching videos from youtube channels like [Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheChernoProject). For exercises we will be doing projects from `1-Beginner`.
