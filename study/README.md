### [ProjectIntroduction](https://github.com/kana800/myProjects/tree/master/study/projectintroduction)

The goal of this project is get familiar with fundamentals of computers and programming. The book [SCIP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) and followed by the [MIT lectures](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/) will cover these basics.
For exercises we will be doing [MIT Problem Sets and Projects](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/projects/).

#### Sub-Projects

<summary>Introduction to Cpp</summary>

This is a fast paced introductory course to `C++` programming language. We will be following the [MIT's 6.096 Course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-096-introduction-to-c-january-iap-2011/index.htm). Note that this course doesnt contain any videos. I will be watching videos from youtube channels like [Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheChernoProject). For exercises we will be doing projects from `1-Beginner`.
