<summary>Challenges</summary>

Today is, `2021-06-03` and I am starting [#100daysofCodingChallenge](https://www.100daysofx.com/faq/), I am planning to study web-development and Steven Skienna algorithm design manual book continuously for 100 days. In web-development I will be learning about the basics while doing projects in [florinpop repo](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas), the commits related to this challenge will be marked as 100daysofCodingChallenge(`X/100`).  In the algorithm design manual book I will be doing questions and watching lectures, the progress of the book and answers for the questions are in this [repository](https://github.com/kana800/selfstudy).
